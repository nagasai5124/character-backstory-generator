# DistilBERT
DistilBERT is pretrained by knowledge distillation to create a smaller model with faster inference and requires less compute to train. Through a triple loss objective during pretraining, language modeling loss, distillation loss, cosine-distance loss, DistilBERT demonstrates similar performance to a larger transformer language model.
